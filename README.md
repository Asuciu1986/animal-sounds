One page site with CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript.

About this little project
This site uses Bootstrap for the main framework, using the Starter template. It uses CSS3 transform for the animations, the HTML5 audio element, and Javascript for the mouseover and mouseout. I also found answers on StackOverflow extremely helpful.
